The purpose of this project is to clean and prepare data as I should if I were working as a Junior Data Analyst.
<br>First of all i would follow some steps to be sure that data is clean  and ready to be validated. Check its reliability, procedence, integrity and completness.
<br>After that, i am gone to determine if data is apropiated to further analysis or if collect more concise data is needed.
