# Worldwide Petrol/Gas prices


The purpose of this project is to clean, prepare, process and analyze data as I should if I were working as a Junior Data Analyst.
<br>First of all i would follow some steps to be sure that data is clean  and ready to be validated. Check its reliability, procedence, integrity and completness.
<br>After that, i am gone to determine if data is apropiated to further analysis or if collect more concise data is needed.

The dataset was uploaded in <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zusmani/petrolgas-prices-worldwide">Kaggle</a> by <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/zusmani">Zeeshan-ul-hassan Usmani</a> under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0: Public Domain</a>.
This dataset contains 2 (almost identical) CSV files. For the purpose of this "Case Study" we are going to use the Petrol Dataset June 23 2022 -- Version 2.csv file. The file compiles information about oil prices, barrels consumed per day, countries shares, price per liter, etc.
<p>
  For cleaning and analysis i choose to use Excel (to have a quick idea of table content and quick graphs) and SQL Server for data cleaning, sorting and filtering.

<br> A quick look to the table show us his structure.
